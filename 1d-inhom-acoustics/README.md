- This is a PyClaw input file to solve acoustics in 1D inhomogeneous medium.
- The user need to run ONLY the file ''script.sh'' from terminal using a command ./script.sh
- Make sure you have execute permission for the file script.sh
- If you do not have the permission, you should change the permission by running this command within the local directory: chmod ugo+rwx script.sh
- Once the run is completed (may take few weeks on a single machine - so recommend to run on a cluster - intelligent parallelization inbuilt), it will generate a file called "SlopePlot.vtr" which you can visualize using Paraview.
- Also it will generate another file called "ParameterPlot.dat" which you can visualize via GNUplot or Python.
- The raw data will be written in ASCII format in a file called "SlopePlot.dat" and one can use python or any other visualization tool (friendly for visualization in ParaView with the .vtr file) to plot these data.
